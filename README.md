Narendra Reddy Peddireddy uses this private repository to house all of the course's code. The following is how this repository is organized.

### Individual_Project_1

### Overview of Individual_Project_1

The goal of this project is to create a GitHub Pages-hosted professional profile website with a JavaScript, jQuery, and React.js personal portfolio. Technical requirements include using an open-source Bootstrap framework for responsive design, integrating two public online APIs, and using JavaScript cookies to display personalized greetings when a user returns. The incorporation of a Google Analytics page tracker to track site traffic and user engagement is one of the non-technical requirements.

The directory can be accessed at https://github.com/narendra2105/peddirny-uc.github.io/edit/main/README.md.


### General requirements:

i.Using a Bootstrap template that was customized and taken from github, the personal portfolio was created. It includes professional details like name, contact information, educational background, experiences, and skills, as well as a section that highlights completed labs and hackathons from the WAPH coursework.

First, I connected to it using a <a> element in the education part. There, beneath the description of my master's degree, is a link for "web application programming and hacking," which, when clicked, takes you to the waph.html page, as you can see in the screenshot I've attached.
